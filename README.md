**Projects Summary**
List of Projects:

1] CAD stent modelling
- Contains the SOLIDWORKS design of a standard PS shaped stent used to treat Coronary Artery Disease (stenosis)
- Background information about the different kinds of commercially available stents and their effectivenes can be found in this study :https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6908811/
  which talks about the superior Hemodynamic and structural performance of the PS shaped stent
- Also contains the Engineering Sketch of the Model
- Currently in the process of printing a scaled model using FDM printers (PLA polymer)
- Slicing software used: UltiMaker Cura

  2] End-of-Line Camera Assembly
  - Function: To reduce inspection time
  - Used to verify placement of chips on PCB at the end of Surface Mounting Tech line 
  - Design to scale using components available.
  - Camera models are placeholders (original models not used for proprietary sake)

  3] Plate spacer assembly
  - Function: Reduce operator/ engineer time taken to replace templates for different products
  - Spaced plates physically on heat stakers
  - Main components intended to be CNC machined
